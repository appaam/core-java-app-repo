/*
 * Race condition where 2 or more threads are racing to gain control over the
 * shared object resulting inconsistent results. This is also called thread interference.
 * 
 * The code that leads to thread interference is called critical section.
 * 
 * Race condition can be avoided through synchronization.
 * Two types of synchronization:
 * 1. method-level synchronization
 * 		apply the keyword, synchronized before returnType of method definition.
 * 		Then the method is called synchronized method.
 * 	    Only one thread will enter into a synchronized method at a time so that
 *      thread interference can be avoided.
 * 2. block-level synchronization
 * 		Instead of applying synchronization for entire method, synchronize only
 *      critical section of the code. This is called synchronized block.
 *      
 *     Synchronized method :
 *     
 *     public synchronized returnType methodName(<parameters>){
 *     
 *     
 *     }
 *      
 *      Synchronized block:
 *      
 *       public returnType methodName(<parameters>){
 *     		
 *     		----------------;
 *     // synchronize only critical section to avoid thread interference
 *     	    synchronized(this){
 *             --------------------;
 *             --------------------;
 *          }
 *          
 *          --------------------;
 *     
 *     }
 *
